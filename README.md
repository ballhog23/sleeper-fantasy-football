# Bleed Blue Fantasy Football
Thanks to the Sleeper team for having a free API to help us keep track of the history and current state of our league.

## Project Scope 
The goal of this project is to learn how to better manage 3rd party data.
Database design, data integrity is the main focus.
Ensuring that incoming data from Sleeper is in the shape we expect and contains all not just some of the data.
If the Sleeper API is ever retired (probably not) the league will still have access to historical data that could be used elsewhere.

## Future
Perhaps this project can be expanded on allowing other Sleeper Leagues to create a site of their own with ease.
